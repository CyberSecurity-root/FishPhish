**now, we have the common URL obfuscation, as you can see there's an @, you need to delete the http:// that is after the @ to make the fake URL works**

# How it works
normal obfuscation works because webs browsers ignore the text before the "@" so, for example in this URL: " https://youtube.com@google.com " you are not entering to youtube we are entering into google, you can use the other program options to hide in a best way the fake URL
